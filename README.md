# Scratch pad for studying ML

## Coding

## ML Basics 

- Refer Machine Learning yearning book
- https://github.com/AstronomerAmber/ML_prep/blob/master/ML_phonescreen_Qs.md
- impl basic models Linear Reg, Logistic Reg, Naive Bayes, KNN[https://github.com/AstronomerAmber/ML_prep/blob/master/Practical_Coding_Challenges/kNN.md]
- Tradeoffs and Usecases [Refer https://github.com/sravya8/ML/blob/master/Other_Traditional_ML_Models.md]

## ML Workflow

- Product Requirements
- Objective functions (Classification, Regression, Clustering, Segmentation)
- Datacollection and labeling
- EDA
- Evaluation Metrics
- Preprocess and Feature eng
- Split data into train, val, test
- Modeling with simple baseline
- Iterate based on bias/variance analysis
- Offline validation
- A/B testing ( business metrics != model/evaluation metrics)
